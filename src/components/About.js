        <p>
          Liquid Disguise owner, Gary Halzel, apprenticed with Boston muralist
          James McGurl from 1983 to 1985. During this time they painted
          landscape murals, trompe l'oeils and created faux effects in paint for
          many restaurants, churches and hotels.
        </p>

          In 1985 Gary began to paint independently, launching Liquid Disguise
          when he was discovered by Bob Vila and featured on Bob Vila's Home
          Again in 1993.
